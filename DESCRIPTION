Description: This R data package loads a concatenated dataframe composed of two-party US Presidential debate transcripts from 1960 to 2020. Each debate transcript is delineated in a one-row per utterance format marked by a distinct document_id (debate and year), candidate (e.g., REAGAN) and turn#.  Each utterance is also marked with associated metadata regarding the candidate (e.g. name, party) and the election outcome (e.g., party_winner).    We initially compiled debate transcripts from the Commission on Presidential Debates (debates.org). Since the debates were widely televised and publicly available, the data are being distributed under fair use (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/) in that their intended use is for academic/scholarly research.  We edited each raw transcript to omit commentator questions and remarks (e.g., "What is the most important issue facing the economy?"). We also ommitted parenthetical transcription notes (e.g., [...coughing]). Researchers are free to make use of this data for any purpose. However, we optimized the format to pair with a companion package (ConversationAlign) designed to analyze alignment between two interlocutors.
